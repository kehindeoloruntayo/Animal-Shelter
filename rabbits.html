          <li>Breed; Alaska rabbit </li>
          <li>Age; 1.5yrs</li>
          <li>Info; Despite its name, the Alaska Rabbit originates in Germany, rather than Alaska. It is a medium-sized rabbit breed, weighing around 3 to 4 kg with glossy black fur, any colour other than black is a fault for this breed. The Alaska rabbit was created in 1900 by Max Fischer, of Gotha, and Schmidt, of Langensalza. They crossed Havanas, Dutch, Himalayans and Champagne d'Argents with the goal of obtaining a rabbit that looks like the Alaskan fox, which would be profitable in the fur trades of that time. They did not achieve this goal, and instead ended up with the black Alaska that is known today. These black Alaskans were first shown in 1907, and imported to North America in the 1970s by Bert Reurs of Canada.</li>

          <li>Info; The Blanc de Hotot is a medium-sized rabbit breed originally developed in France. It is a compact, thickset white rabbit with spectacle-like black rings around each dark eye. First bred in Hotot-en-Auge, Normandy, France in the early 1900s, the breed spread throughout Europe and into North America by the 1920s. Initially unpopular in the United States, it died out there, and suffered population decline in World War II-era Europe. It began to spread again in the 1960s and 1970s, and was re-imported to the US in 1978. Today it is recognized by the British Rabbit Council and the American Rabbit Breeders Association, but is considered globally endangered, with a listing of "threatened" by ALBC</li>

          <li>Breed; Belgian Hare</li>
          <li>Age; 1.5yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The Belgian Hare is a breed of domestic rabbit that has been selectively bred to resemble the wild European hare. It is a rabbit rather than a true hare. Averaging 2.7 to 4.1 kg, the Belgian Hare is known for its slender and wiry frame and its long and powerful legs. The precursors of the Belgian Hare were created in Belgium in the early 18th century, through the crossbreeding of early domestic rabbits with the wild European rabbit. The intent was to create a practical meat rabbit for small livestock. These rabbits were first imported to England in 1874, where they were dubbed the "Belgian Hare".The precursors of the Belgian Hare were created in Belgium in the early 18th century.</li>

          <li>Breed; Chinchilla Rabbit</li>
          <li>Age; 1.5yrs</li>
          <li>Info; Chinchilla rabbits are a group of three rabbit breeds that have been bred for a coat that resembles that of chinchillas. Despite their name, they are not related to and cannot interbreed with chinchillas, which are a species of rodent. Rabbits are lagomorphs. A mutation diluted the yellow pigment in the hairs to almost white, changing in this way the color of the fur of the wild rabbit (agouti) into chinchilla. The American Chinchilla or "Heavyweight Chinchilla" is larger than the Standard Chinchilla, it has a commercial body type but the same roll back coat. Standard Chinchillas bred for large size produced this breed.</li>

          <li>Breed; Mini Lop</li>
          <li>Age; 1.5yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The Mini Lop is a breed of domestic rabbit that is recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). It is different from the Miniature Lop breed that is recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC). The Mini Lop [US] and the Miniature Lop [UK] are different from the Dwarf Lop breed that is recognized by the BRC. The Mini Lop is similar to several other small rabbit breeds, such as the Dwarf rabbit. Bob Herschbach discovered the Mini Lop breed at a German National Rabbit Show in Essen, Germany in 1972, where it was known as a Klein Widder. These first Mini Lops were originated from the German Big Lop and the small Chinchilla.</li>

          <li>Breed; Flemish Giant rabbit</li>
          <li>Age; 1.5yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The Flemish Giant rabbit is the largest breed of domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus). Flemish Giants are historically a utility breed used for their fur and meat. They are often kept as pets as they are known for being docile and patient when being handled. The Flemish Giant originated in Flanders. It was bred as early as the 16th century near the city of Ghent, Belgium. It is believed to have descended from a number of meat and fur breeds, possibly including the Steenkonijn ("Stone Rabbit"â€”referring to the old Belgian weight size of one stone or about 3.8 kilograms) and the European "Patagonian" breed (now extinct). This "Patagonian" rabbit.</li>
