          <li>Breed; Ring-necked</li>
          <li>Age; 1yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The ring-necked snake is a harmless species of colubrid snake found throughout much of the United States, central Mexico, and south-eastern Canada. Ring-necked snakes are secretive, nocturnal snakes, so are rarely seen during the day time. They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails, exposing their bright red-orange posterior, ventral surface when threatened. Ring-necked snakes are believed to be fairly abundant throughout most of their range, though no scientific evaluation supports this hypothesis. Scientific research is lacking for the ring-necked snake, and more in-depth investigations are greatly needed.</li>

          <li>Breed; Western Hognose</li>
          <li>Age; 1yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The western hognose snake is a relatively small, stout-bodied snake. Its color and pattern is highly variable between subspecies, although most specimens appear much like rattlesnakes to the untrained eye, which appears to be Batesian mimicry. This snake gets its common name, "hognose", from the modified rostral scale that is formed in an upturned manner, providing a very "hog-like" look. Additionally, this adaptation makes these snakes adept burrowers. The species is not dangerous to humans, but there exists scientific debate regarding whether the mild toxins in the hognose's bite result from saliva, harmful to its preferred wild food source; toads.</li>

          <li>Breed; Egyptian sand boa</li>
          <li>Age; 1yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The Egyptian sand boa is heavily-built snake with a small head, small eyes, vertical pupils, and a short tail. Scale texture is extremely smooth, except on the tail, which is covered in bumps. Adult female specimens of G. colubrinus are rarely more than 91 cm in total length (including tail). The average Egyptian sand boa grows no longer than 30-60cm long, with males being significantly smaller than females. The color pattern may consist of a yellow or orange coloration overlaid with dark brown splotches. The belly is white- or cream-colored. It is readily available in the pet trade due to its small size, docility and ease of care.</li>

          <li>Breed; Garter</li>
          <li>Age; 1yrs</li>
          <li>Info; Garter snake is a common name for generally harmless, small to medium-sized snakes belonging to the genus Thamnophis in the family Colubridae. Native to North and Central America, species in the genus Thamnophis can be found from the subarctic plains of Canada to Costa Rica. With about 35 recognized species and subspecies, garter snakes are highly variable in appearance. They generally have large round eyes, round pupils, a slender build, keeled scales, and a pattern of longitudinal stripes that may or may not include spots. They also vary significantly in total length from as short as 18â€³ to as long as 51" With no real consensus on the classification of species of Thamnophis.</li>

          <li>Breed; Smooth green</li>
          <li>Age; 1yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The smooth green snake (Opheodrys vernalis) is a species of North American nonvenomous snake in the family Colubridae. The species is also referred to as the grass snake. It is a slender snake that measures 36 to 51 cm as an adult. It gets its common name from its smooth dorsal scales, as opposed to the rough green snake, which has keeled dorsal scales. The smooth green snake is found in marshes, meadows, open woods, and along stream edges, and is native to regions of Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. A non-aggressive snake, it seldom bites and usually flees when threatened. It mates in late spring to summer, and females lay their eggs from June to September.</li>

        <h4>Toothless</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Breed; Arabian Egg eater</li>
          <li>Age; 1yrs</li>
          <li>Info; As obligate ovivores, they are arboreal, preferring to remain in the trees where they can locate bird-nests, and tend to be nocturnal as this is when the diurnal bird species they prey upon are asleep and most likely to leave their eggs unguarded. Their diet also affects their biology, and has resulted in an evolutionary adaptation that has removed their teeth and substantially increased the capacity of their necks. This facilitates the consumption of whole eggs. Once inside the neck, three bony projections from the cervical vertebrae are extended and the egg is crushed against them, puncturing and cracking it. The eggs are then squeezed to extract the liquids inside, and the shell is regurgitated.</li>
