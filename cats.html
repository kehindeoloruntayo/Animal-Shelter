        <ul>
          <li>Breed; American Bobtail</li>
          <li>Age; 1.5yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s. It
            is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail.
            This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a
            Manx cat. The breed is not related to the Japanese Bobtail despite the similar name and physical typeâ€”the
            breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be
            different because the mutation causing the American Bobtail's tail is dominant.</li>

        <h4>Bella</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Breed; Bengal</li>
          <li>Age; 1.5yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from a hybrid of the Asian leopard cat
            (Prionailurus bengalensis), with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau. It is then usually bred
            with a breed that has a more friendly personality, because after breeding a cat with a wildcat, its friendly
            personality may not be there in the kitten. The breed name comes from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.
            Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their leopard cat ancestry, and their coats
            may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling. They are an energetic breed that needs much
            exercise.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Breed; Balinese & Javanese</li>
          <li>Age; 2yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The Balinese is a long-haired breed of domestic cat with Siamese-style point coloration and
            sapphire-blue eyes. The Balinese is also known as the purebred long-haired Siamese, since it originated as a
            natural mutation of that breed and hence is essentially the same cat but with a medium-length silky coat and
            a distinctively plumed tail. As is the case with their short-haired counterparts, a genetic distinction is
            made between traditional or "old-style" and modern body types. In the American standard, color variants
            derived from the Colorpoint Shorthair are further considered a separate breed, known as the Javanese.</li>

          <li>Breed; Chartreux</li>
          <li>Age; 6months</li>
          <li>Info; The Chartreux is a rare breed of cat from France, and is recognised by a number of registries around
            the world. The Chartreux is large and muscular (called cobby) with relatively short, fine-boned limbs, and
            very fast reflexes. They are known for their blue (silver-grey) water-resistant short hair double coats
            which are often slightly thick in texture (often showing "breaks" like a sheepskin) and orange or
            copper-coloured eyes. Chartreux cats are also known for their "smile"; due to the structure of their heads
            and their tapered muzzles, they often appear to be smiling. Chartreux are exceptional hunters and are highly
            prized by farmers.</li>

          <li>Breed; Egyptian Mau</li>
          <li>Age; 2yrs</li>
          <li>Info; Egyptian Maus are a small to medium-sized short-haired cat breed. They are one of the few naturally
            spotted breeds of domesticated cat. The spots of the Mau occur on only the tips of the hairs of its coat. It
            is considered a rare breed. Egyptian Maus are considered by proponents to be one of the progenitor breeds of
            the modern domestic cat. The breed conformation is described as "a balance between the compactness of a
            Burmese and the slim elegance of a Siamese. Its medium-length body is muscular, with the hind legs longer
            than the front, giving the Mau the appearance of standing on tiptoes when upright." The Egyptian Mau is the
            fastest of the domestic cats.</li>

          <li>Breed; LaPerm</li>
          <li>Age; 2yrs</li>
          <li>Info; The LaPerm is a breed of cat. A LaPerm's fur is curly (hence the name "perm"), with the tightest
            curls being on the throat and on the base of the ears. LaPerms come in many colors and patterns. LaPerms
            generally have a very affectionate personality. The LaPerm is a rex breed which originated in the United
            States and is now present in many other countries worldwide. The breed is genetically unique and not related
            to any other rex cat varieties, having a dominant gene causing their curly coats. They have an elegant and
            athletic build and are affectionate, active, and outgoing in character. They are reputed to be
            hypoallergenic cats.</li>
